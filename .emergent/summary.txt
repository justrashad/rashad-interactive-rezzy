The trajectory documents an iterative and highly user-driven development process for creating a custom interactive resume. The project began as a request to clone , but quickly evolved into a bespoke application for a user named Rashad Washington.

The development process was characterized by a tight feedback loop. The initial implementation focused on replicating the basic aesthetic with customized content. Subsequent user feedback led to several major architectural pivots:
1.  From a single-scene layout to a multi-level design.
2.  From generic level themes to a highly specific, creative narrative proposed by the user.
3.  From a discrete, level-based structure to a continuous, side-scrolling world, which was a fundamental change in the core game mechanic to better match the reference site.
4.  From static scenes to complex, state-driven interactive gameplay within each scene (e.g., basketball, swimming, a boss fight).

The AI engineer successfully managed these pivots by modifying core components like  (the game logic/state manager),  (the world renderer), and  (the player animator), with most of the visual and animation logic being implemented in a large, monolithic  file. The most recent work involves implementing a large batch of simultaneous feature requests to add significant detail and interactivity to the character and various levels. The final action was to attempt a screenshot to verify these latest changes.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build a pixel-perfect, creative, and interactive side-scrolling resume website that clones the functionality and aesthetic of . The application is customized for Rashad Washington, using his professional details extracted from a provided resume.

**Core Features:**
-   **Continuous Side-Scrolling World:** A single, continuous world (currently 12000px wide) that the user traverses horizontally.
-   **Custom Character:** A brown-skinned, pixel-art character representing Rashad. The character must have different, detailed outfits for each level (e.g., nerd outfit, basketball uniform, scuba gear, Black Panther suit).
-   **Narrative-Driven Levels:** The world is divided into distinct, themed sections that tell Rashad's professional story, including a custom-designed basketball court in Houston, an underwater scene, an industrial area for a boss fight, and a rooftop finale.
-   **Interactive Gameplay:** Each scene must have unique, engaging mechanics. This includes:
    -   A basketball scene where the character dribbles, shoots (via spacebar), and scores in front of a full, diverse crowd.
    -   An underwater scene where the character dives and swims (with scuba gear and oxygen bubbles).
    -   A boss battle against a detailed evil robot.
-   **Aesthetics:** Maintain a retro, Super Mario Bros-inspired pixel-art style, using the Press Start 2P font and ensuring all transitions and animations are smooth (60fps).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js:** Used for the frontend, with a component-based architecture.
- **State Management:** Core logic is driven by React hooks (, ) to manage global state like  (the horizontal scroll position) and  (e.g., 'exploring', 'basketball', 'swimming').
- **Event Handling:** Keyboard events (, ) are used for continuous character movement and interactive actions (e.g., jump, shoot).
- **CSS Animations:** Extensive use of  and  properties in a single  file to handle all character animations, background scrolling, and UI element transitions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a frontend-only React application. The core logic simulates a side-scrolling game within the browser.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the React application.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Initially a boilerplate file, it was rewritten to render the main  component, establishing the root of the application.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the primary game engine component. It holds the core state, including , , and . It also contains the master  hook for handling all keyboard inputs (, ) to manage continuous movement and actions like jumping or shooting.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file has undergone significant evolution, from simple level switching to managing a continuous  for the side-scrolling effect. It now calculates the current  based on  and passes it down to child components.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This component is the world renderer. It contains the JSX for all the backgrounds, environments, and interactive elements (e.g., basketball hoop, underwater chests, boss robot). It uses the  prop to apply a  style, creating the illusion of a scrolling world behind the character.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file grew from a single scene to containing the structure for all 7 distinct, narrative-driven sections. It has been repeatedly updated to add more detailed environmental objects and interactive set pieces.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This component renders the player character. Its appearance and animation are determined by props like  and .
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The character's CSS classes are dynamically applied here to trigger different animations (walking, jumping, dribbling, swimming). It was recently updated to handle rendering different outfits based on the character's location in the world.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A critical, monolithic file that contains all the application's styling. This includes the pixel-art designs for the character and its various outfits, all environmental and level backgrounds, interactive element styles (basketball, bubbles, robot), and all  for animations.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file has been extensively modified in almost every user feedback cycle to visually create the requested features. Most recently, CSS for detailed character outfits, a full basketball crowd, swimming effects, and a robot boss was added.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A simple JavaScript object that externalizes all the text content (professional experience, skills, level titles) used in the application.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Updated to reflect the creative narrative for the different levels.

<pending_tasks>
- **Visual Verification:** The most recent batch of extensive changes has not been visually verified. The last action was to take a screenshot, but the results have not been analyzed.
- **Debugging:** It is highly likely that the last set of simultaneous, complex feature additions (character outfits, basketball mechanics, swimming effects, boss fight) introduced visual bugs or functional issues that need to be identified and fixed.
- **Sound Design:** Add sound effects and background music.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Implement touch controls for mobile devices.
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensure all animations run at a smooth 60fps.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the final phase of implementing a large, multi-part user request aimed at adding significant detail and interactivity to the application. The specific tasks addressed were:

1.  **Character Outfits:** The  component and  were updated to give the character a unique, detailed outfit for each level (nerd, basketball uniform, scuba gear, Black Panther suit).
2.  **Basketball Scene Enhancement:** The  component was modified to include a full crowd of spectators. The  component was updated to handle ball dribbling and shooting mechanics, triggered by the spacebar. Corresponding styles and animations were added to .
3.  **Swimming Scene Enhancement:** Logic was added in  and  to render the character in scuba gear and emit oxygen bubbles while underwater.
4.  **Boss Battle Implementation:** The initial framework for a boss battle was created in , including a detailed evil robot boss and the logic for a fighting sequence.

All the code for these features has been written and committed. The immediate last action was to invoke the  to get a visual confirmation of whether these complex, interconnected features were implemented correctly or if they broke the application. The work is therefore mid-verification and debugging.

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the output of the most recent screenshot command to visually verify the implementation of the new character outfits, the enhanced basketball scene, the swimming effects, and the boss battle. Based on the image, identify any bugs or visual inconsistencies to fix next.
